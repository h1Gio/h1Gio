# README.md
Hi, I'm E. Gio a 17yr coder and I'm on my journey to becoming a fullstack/10x Dev.
I started my journey on linux and would now say I am a power user, with there always being more, I love to learn new things about linux and coding!.
I'm now learning HTML and CSS to get a good grasp on web development, as well as Python for fun.
